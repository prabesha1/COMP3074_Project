DineSmart is a modern, user-friendly restaurant-guide application that lets users explore dining options with ratings, reviews, and location details.

✨ Prototype Highlights

✅ Complete Screen Set – Splash · List · Details · Add · Map · About

✅ Working Navigation – Built with Jetpack Compose Navigation

✅ Material 3 Design – Modern, clean, and fully responsive

✅ Dummy Data – Static restaurant list for demo purposes

✅ Interactive Buttons & Flows – Simulated add / map / details screens
